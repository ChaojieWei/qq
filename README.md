# Use Virtualenv
Before installing python dependencies I advise you to use virtualenv 
(https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to avoid to mess up 
with your sistem libraries.
if you don't have virtualenv installed follow the installation guide
available on the virtualenv site
To setup a virtual enviroment you just need to run this command:

    virtualenv venv

And then to use the virtual environment

    source venv/bi/activate

To deactivate the environment simply run

    deactivate

# Install required Python packages
For running this script you need to have an updated version of Pip
installed (See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ for how to install it).
### Linux / Mac OS X systems
In order to use my code you have just to run the setup.sh 
with the command from:
    
    bash setup.sh

### Windows sistems
Here https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/python/pip-for-windows 
you will find a good starting point for using pip and virtualenv on 
Windows once you configure Python for Windows properly.
There is a non tested setup.bat similar to the Linux one. Take it
as a descriptive file for the steps to follow to install
the required dependencies and source files.
    

# Running the script
If nothing went wrong you can already run the main script file
that implements a Convolutional Neural Network and it is already
set up for loading the datasets considered in the paper.
To run the Python script file from the main directory:

    python cnn/cnn.py
    
To select the dataset you can use the option

    --dataset=DATASET
where possible values for DATASET are

    [extFTIR,extNIR,extRaman,TABLET_NIR,TABLET_Raman,
    extWINE,OIL,COFFEE,extSTRAWBERRY]
              
To load the best trained network you have to use in addition
the option
    
    --load_dataset

If you also want to see the value of the main parameters of the network
you have to use also

    --short_print_network

Instead if you want to train a new network you have to add only the 
option

    --hyperparameter_optimization=SEARCH_METHOD
    
where the possible search methods are

    [RANDOM,EXHAUSTIVE]
    
after selecting the dataset to use with --dataset=DATASET_NAME
For the full list of the script options use

    --help
